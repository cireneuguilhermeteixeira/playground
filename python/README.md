# Playground

This repository is a **personal playground of Proofs of Concept (POCs)**, experiments, and technical explorations.

It is intentionally designed as a **living lab**: ideas are tested, validated, discarded, or evolved over time.  
Nothing here should be considered final or production-ready unless explicitly stated.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

This repository exists to:

- Explore new technologies, languages, and frameworks
- Validate architectural ideas and system designs
- Test performance, scalability, and trade-offs
- Keep experiments isolated and disposable
- Document technical learning through real code

Each experiment is treated as a **POC**, not a product.

---

## Organization Philosophy

There is **no fixed or strict structure**.

Directories may be organized by:
- Language
- Technology
- Framework
- Domain
- Experiment type

This flexibility allows the repository to evolve naturally as new interests and technologies are explored.

Each POC should be:
- Self-contained
- Easy to delete or refactor
- Independent from other experiments

---

## POCs Index (Auto-generated)

An up-to-date index of all POCs is generated automatically based on the repository structure.

- **POCs index:** [`POCS.md`](./POCS.md)

The index includes:
- Total number of POCs
- Grouping based on directory structure
- Direct links to each POC

Whenever a new POC is added, this index is updated automatically.

## What You May Find Here

Depending on the experiment, POCs may include:

- Backend services and APIs
- Distributed systems experiments
- Messaging and event-driven architectures
- Infrastructure and DevOps tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Language comparisons
- Frontend and mobile experiments
- Algorithms and low-level explorations

Some POCs are small and focused. Others are more elaborate.

---

## Stability and Expectations

- POCs may be incomplete or abandoned
- Code quality and style may vary
- Breaking changes are expected
- Documentation may be minimal or absent

This repository favors **learning over polish**.
