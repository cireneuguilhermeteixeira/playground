# Playground

This repository is a **personal playground of Proofs of Concept (POCs)**, experiments, and technical explorations.

It is intentionally designed as a **living lab**: ideas are tested, validated, discarded, or evolved over time.  
Nothing here should be considered final or production-ready unless explicitly stated.
